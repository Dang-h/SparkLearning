One, maybe rather trivial, observation is that in mathematics, rational numbers do not have mutable
state. You can add one rational number to another,  You can add one rational number to another, but the result will be a new rational number. The
original numbers will not have "changed." The immutable Rational class we'll design in this chapter
will have the same property. Each rational number will be represented by one Rational object. When
you add two Rational objects, you'll create a newRational object to hold the sum.
